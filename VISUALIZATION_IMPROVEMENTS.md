# HCV Visualization Improvements

## Current Issues Identified

### 1. Main Overview Plot
- **Issue**: Overlapping dots create visual clutter
- **Issue**: Symlog color scale is not intuitive
- **Issue**: No clear indication of interactivity
- **Issue**: Poor use of space with excessive padding

### 2. Detail Plots
- **Issue**: Excessive left padding (250px) wastes screen space
- **Issue**: Inconsistent sizing between the three plots
- **Issue**: Repetitive color legends
- **Issue**: No visual connection between main plot selection and detail plots

### 3. Layout & Responsiveness
- **Issue**: Fixed widths don't adapt to screen size
- **Issue**: Massive faceted plot (5000px height) is overwhelming
- **Issue**: Poor vertical spacing and organization

### 4. User Experience
- **Issue**: No loading states or error handling
- **Issue**: No tooltips or hover information
- **Issue**: Missing data (N/A) not handled gracefully
- **Issue**: No clear feedback on selections
